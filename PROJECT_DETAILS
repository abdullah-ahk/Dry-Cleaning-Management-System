Dry Cleaning Management System
<br>
Introduction:
<br>
In today's fast-paced world, dry cleaning businesses face the challenge of managing numerous orders,
ensuring timely deliveries, and keeping track of customer preferences. Traditional manual processes can lead to inefficiencies and mistakes,
resulting in poor customer service.
The Dry Cleaning Management System offers a solution by automating these processes,
enabling businesses to focus on delivering quality service while managing their operations efficiently.
<br>
Background Information
<br>
The system addresses the growing need for a digital solution that automates order management, tracks customer history,
and maintains accurate records of transactions. 
It is particularly beneficial for smaller businesses that may find existing software solutions too costly or complex to implement.
<br>
Problem Statement:
<br>
Dry cleaning businesses often struggle with handling multiple orders, maintaining accurate transaction records,
and ensuring smooth operations without errors.
Most available digital solutions are either too expensive or lack the tailored functionality required by smaller businesses.

Project Objectives and Scope
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Develop a secure login/signup system for customers.
<br>
Enable customers to place and track their dry cleaning orders.
<br>
Provide an order history feature for customers to view their past transactions.
<br>
Ensure a user-friendly interface and operational efficiency.
<br>
Implement data security measures to maintain customer confidentiality.
<br>
<br>
The scope of this project includes:
<br>
Designing an easy-to-navigate graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
Developing backend functionality using Java and object-oriented programming principles.
Implementing database management with MS Access using JDBC for database connectivity.
Testing the system thoroughly using JUnit to ensure reliability.
Methodology
The project is structured using a three-tier architecture:

Presentation Layer: This layer handles the user interface, developed using Java Swing for an interactive and intuitive experience.
Business Logic Layer: Core business functionalities, such as order processing and customer management, are handled here using well-structured Java classes.
Data Access Layer: The system uses JDBC to communicate with an MS Access database, ensuring smooth data storage and retrieval.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Java
GUI: Java Swing
Database: MS Access, connected through JDBC
Testing: JUnit for unit testing
Development Environment: Apache NetBeans
Installation and Setup
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install the following dependencies:
Java Development Kit (JDK)
MS Access Database
JDBC libraries for database connectivity
Open the project in Apache NetBeans and set up the database configurations.
Run the project and follow the instructions to begin managing orders and customer data.
Design and Architecture
The system uses a modular design based on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure easy maintenance and future scalability.
The three-tier architecture separates the concerns of UI, logic, and data management, allowing for better organization and code management.
<br>
Future Enhancements:
<br>
Add support for multiple languages for wider accessibility.
Integration with online payment systems for seamless transactions.
Implement cloud storage for enhanced data access and scalability.
Build a mobile-friendly version of the system for ease of use.
