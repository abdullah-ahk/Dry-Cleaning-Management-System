## 📝 **Introduction**

In a world where time is of the essence, dry cleaning businesses need to manage orders and customer data efficiently. Traditional methods involving manual entry and tracking are not only tedious but prone to error. The **Dry Cleaning Management System** provides a complete solution by automating these tasks, ensuring better organization and an enhanced customer experience.

---

## 🚩 **Problem Statement**

Dry cleaning businesses often face challenges in:
- Managing multiple customer orders simultaneously.
- Keeping accurate records of transactions.
- Ensuring timely order processing and customer satisfaction.

Existing solutions are often too expensive for smaller businesses or do not cater to their specific needs. This project aims to provide a cost-effective, feature-rich alternative.

## 🎯 **Project Objectives and Scope**

### **Objectives**:
- Develop a **secure** and **intuitive** system for customer authentication (login/signup).
- Enable easy **order placement** and **history tracking**.
- Build a **user-friendly dashboard** for customers.
- Ensure **data integrity** and **efficient management** of business operations.

### **Scope**:
- Design a **Java Swing** GUI for seamless user interaction.
- Implement the backend using **object-oriented principles** to ensure modularity.
- Use **JDBC** for robust database operations with **MS Access**.

## 🛠️ **Methodology**

The project follows a **three-tier architecture** to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

### **1. Presentation Layer (Java Swing)**  
This layer is responsible for managing the user interface, offering an intuitive experience for both business operators and customers.

### **2. Business Logic Layer (Java Classes)**  
This layer handles the core functionalities such as order management, customer data, and business rules. Object-oriented programming principles ensure modularity and scalability.

### **3. Data Access Layer (JDBC + MS Access)**  
The data access layer ensures that all database operations, such as storing orders and retrieving customer history, are handled efficiently. JDBC ensures smooth interaction with the MS Access database.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing for creating interactive user interfaces.
- **Database**: MS Access (via JDBC) for data storage and retrieval.
- **Testing**: JUnit for ensuring code quality and reliability.
- **Development Environment**: Apache NetBeans
